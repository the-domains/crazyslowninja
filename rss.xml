            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Welcome :-)</h1><p>You have reached the web site of a dedicated, albeit not very good Xbox One & 360 gamer. One who always has lots to say, whether that is blogging about anything and everything that comes across his mind regarding Xbox gaming or baiting or cursing other players online.In his 40's CrazySlow Ninja loves first person shooters, air combat and role playing games (RPG) but most importantly loves the online banter that goes on whilst playing on Xbox Live. If you come across him online, let him know you've been here, depending on how much you kill or help him will definitely influence whether you find yourself on his hit list or his allies list. I hope you enjoy your visit, it's all a bit tongue and cheek, if you're looking for anything serious, best you leave now!! Don't forget to follow me on Twitter or FaceBook, the links for which are at the top of the page.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4c615ad0-9ddd-45a5-b9b2-49e64da0c23b.png"></article>]]></description>
