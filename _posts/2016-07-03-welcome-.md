  You have reached the web site of a dedicated, albeit not very good Xbox One &
  360 gamer. One who always has lots to say, whether that is blogging about
  anything and everything that comes across his mind regarding Xbox gaming or
  baiting or cursing other players online.In his 40's CrazySlow Ninja loves
  first person shooters, air combat and role playing games (RPG) but most
  importantly loves the online banter that goes on whilst playing on Xbox Live.
  If you come across him online, let him know you've been here, depending on how
  much you kill or help him will definitely influence whether you find yourself
  on his hit list or his allies list. I hope you enjoy your visit, it's all a
  bit tongue and cheek, if you're looking for anything serious, best you leave
  now!! Don't forget to follow me on Twitter or FaceBook, the links for which
  are at the top of the page.
